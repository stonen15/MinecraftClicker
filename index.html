				<h2>Game Premise</h2>
				<p>
					In our game, the player must earn ingame currency in a Minecraft theme world. The player will earn money by clicking a button and the entire game will be based on clicking. The player will be able to purchase items that increase the rate at which they gain money. The main goal of our game is like any other clicking game, to keep gaining more and more of the in-game currency but alternative Minecraft and clicking themed activities will be available.

				<h2>Possible Challenges</h2>
				<p>
					We plan using arrays to complete an inventory system which the player can add or sell items from the shop.
					<br>
					For bubble sorting, we plan to use it to organize the inventory as the player purchase or sell items.

				<h2>Screens</h2>
				<p>
					<u>Main game screen:</u> On the main screen, there will be a clicker button/icon centered in the middle of the screen. The icon can be clicked to produce money. There will also be buttons such as help, shop, etc. that will transfer you to the designated page or screen. The score (or money count) will be located across the top of the screen in a banner. 
					<br>
					<br>
					<u>Shop screen:</u> This will be a pop-up on the main game screen. The screen will pop-up when the shop button is click. The shop screen contains many item the player can purchase to increase the money genereation rate.
					<br>
					<br>
					<u>Help screen:</u> This page will be contain a "how to play" section that will help players better understand how to play the game if they are confused.

				<h2>Concerns</h2>
				<p>
					One of the biggest challenges will be implementing the bubble sort aspect of the game. Other possible challenges we could face include not understanding how to make certain aspects of the game, such as complex loops and logic problems. Another problem we could face is errors with the scope of our variables as we are going to need a lot of variables to be used in different parts of the game. Other problems would be syntax errors as more and more code accumulates and getting the best sprites for the game.
